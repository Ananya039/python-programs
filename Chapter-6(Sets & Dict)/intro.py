            #PROPERTIES OF DICTIONARY
# 1. Unordered: The items in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order.
# 2. Mutable: You can change the values associated with keys, add new key-value pairs, or remove existing ones.
# 3. Key-Value Pairs: Each item in a dictionary is a pair consisting of a key and its corresponding value.
# # 4. Unique Keys: Each key in a dictionary must be unique; you cannot have two items with the same key.
# it is indexed by keys, not by numbers like lists or tuples.
# 5. Dynamic Size: Dictionaries can grow and shrink as needed, allowing you to add or remove items dynamically.
