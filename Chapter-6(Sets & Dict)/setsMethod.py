          #PROPERTIES OF SETS
# 1. Unordered: The items in a set are not stored in any particular order, and you cannot access them by index.
# 2. Mutable: You can add or remove elements from a set after it is created.
# sets are unindexed, meaning you cannot access elements by their position like you can with lists or tuples.
# There is no way to change items in set
# Sets cannot contain duplicate elements, meaning that each element in a set must be unique.
